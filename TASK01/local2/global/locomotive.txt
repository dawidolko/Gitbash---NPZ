A locomotive stands at the station,
Heavy, huge and sweat drips from it:
Fatty oil.
It stands and puffs, pant and blows,
The heat from its heated belly bursts:
Puff - how hot!
Uh - how hot!
Puff - how hot!
Uff - how hot! They hitched to it huge and heavy wagons made of iron steel and full of people in each wagon and in one there are cows and in the second horses and in the third there are only fat people sitting and eating fat sausages and the fourth wagon is full of bananas and in the fifth there are six pianos...
