In the river of Heraclitus
the cod catches fish
the cod quarters the fish with a sharp fish,
the ruby ​​builds the fish, the cod lives in the fish,
the cod escapes from the besieged fish.

In the river of Heraclitus
The fish invented the fish above the fish,
The fish kneels before the fish, the fish sings to the fish,
It asks the fish to swim easier.
