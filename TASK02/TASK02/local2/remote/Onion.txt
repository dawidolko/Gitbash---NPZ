The onion is different.
It has no insides.
It is itself through and through,
the onion to the point of onionness.

Onion-like on the outside,
onion-like to the core,
the onion could look into itself
without fear.

In us, foreignness and savagery
barely covered by skin,
inferno in us, internal medicine,
violent anatomy,
and in the onion, onion,
not twisted intestines.
It is often naked,
it is like it to the core.
