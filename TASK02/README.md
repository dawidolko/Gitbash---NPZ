### **Task 4.**

Go back to local and create a file called Cebula.txt and put the text in it (Polish characters are not necessary):

```
An onion is different.
It has no insides.
It is itself through and through, an onion
to the point of onionness.
Onion-like on the outside,
onion-like to the core,
an onion could look into itself
without being terrified.
```

### **Task 5.**
Add a new file to the repository and commit with the description "onion".

### **Task 6.**

### **Task 9.**
Create a garbage.doc file with the following content: "there's nothing interesting here."

### **Task 10.**
Save the log of changes in the repository in the log.txt file, then add it to the repository and save it with the description "logs".

### **Task 11.**
Update the remote repository.

### **Task 12.**

### **Task 14.**
Navigate to the local2 directory and clone the contents of the remote repository to it.

### **Task 15.**
Add another verse to the Cebula.txt file (in the local2/remote directory):

```
There is foreignness and wildness within us
barely covered with skin,
inferno in us internal medicine,
violent anatomy,
and onion in onion,
not twisted gut.
She is naked many times,
profoundly similar.
```

### **Task 16.**
Save the changes locally with the description "second verse" and then send them to remote.

```
Being consistent, onion,
successful onion creation.
In one simply the second,
in the larger one the smaller one,
and in the next another,`
that is the third and fourth.
Centripetal fugue.
Echo composed in a choir.
```

### **Task 26.**
Go to the local2/remote folder and add "Ah, that onion!" at the end of the file.
